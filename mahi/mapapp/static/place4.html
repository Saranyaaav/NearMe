    Ayappakkam is a Western suburb of Chennai in Thiruvallur district in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Ayapakkam is currently a village panchayat surrounded by Thiruverkadu municipality, Avadi corporation and Greater Chennai Corporations.
    Situated between Ambattur Industrial Estate, avadi and Thiruverkadu . Ayappakkam developed as a residential area, since 1990, after Tamil Nadu Housing Board quarters came up. Unlike Ambattur that houses more industrial units, Ayappakkam is predominantly a residential area and it connects with the city, via Anna Nagar, Mogappair, Nolambur, Athipet and Maduravoyal, through Poonamallee High Road, Chennai-Tiruvallur High (CTH) Road and Ambattur Industrial Estate Road.
